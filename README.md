# FGQL

Welcome to the FGQL repository!

## What is FGQL?

FGQL is a MariaDB SQL script that creates a database to hold frame data for fighting games

## Why using FGQL?

Frame data is already available at other apps and sites, such as Kurogane Hammer (Super Smash Bros. For Wii U), FAT (Street Fighter V) or RBNorway (Tekken 7). Why using FGQL then? Well, since it's a SQL database, you can use SQL queries as complex as you want (How many characters have positive middle attacks with 10 frames of startup?), which aren't supported by those.

## Does FGQL come with frame data?

As of now, no. The database is completely empty, you're supposed to fill it with the frame data. However, I might add scripts with the frame data for some games in the future.

## Is FGQL game-specific?

FGQL has been desgined so it can support as many different games as possible.

## Can I modify FGQL?

Of course! FGQL is free software and is under GPL license, so you're free to modify it as you wish!

## Which DBMS are supported?

MariaDB is the recommended DBMS. However, it should also work on MySQL. Other DBMS haven't been tested.
